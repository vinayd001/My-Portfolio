                <p>
                    Given that there will be approximately <strong>1.4 million computing jobs available in 2020</strong>, 
                    with only 400,000 qualified developers to fill them, those interested in acquiring 
                    in-demand skills can certainly benefit from having web development and coding in their 
                    resume. It's safe to say there is, and will continue to be, high demand for web developers. 
                    You won't have to worry about finding jobs for web developers any time soon.

                <p>
                    According to U.S. News & World Report, certified professional web developers earn an average salary of 
                    $64,970 nation wide. Salary shouldn't be the only factor when deciding whether or not to learn web 
                    development, but it should be taken into consideration. With the average household income in the United 
                    States being $56,516 in 2017, average income for web developers looks pretty nice.

                <p>
                    If you're serious about learning how to code, there are several options for web dev education. You can do a 
                    CS degree, teach yourself online, or do a bootcamp. All are great options; it really depends on how quickly 
                    you want to get out into the workforce. The benefit of bootcamp is that you can know how to code, and code well, 
                    in 13 weeks. 13 weeks! It's an intense 13 weeks, but you will have people dedicated to your success in learning 
                    and finding a job throughout your bootcamp experience. Before you know it, you'll be in a career you're finally 
                    excited about!

                    Have freedom to work whenever you want from wherever—imagine that. All you need for web development is the internet and a laptop. Not all jobs are remote, but if that is your preference, there are remote jobs out there for you.

                <p>
                    Tech is where to be right now. Because there is such a high demand for web developers and so little trained developers to fill those positions, tech companies are doing an excellent job at making work like very comfortable, if not enjoyable. If you choose to work for a tech company as a web developer, you'll enjoy free food, ping pong, and rad coworkers.

                    If you're the type that likes to work project to project on your own terms, then being a freelance web developer is for you. Once you join the web dev community, you will find that there are plenty of opportunities for you to freelance. Coming right out of bootcamp, you can charge $50 an hour—depending on where you live—for your work. And, that will only increase as you become more skilled.
